This repository contains the raw code of the manuscript

"BAYESIAN  TIME-VARYING  TENSOR  VECTOR  AUTOREGRESSIVEmMODELS FOR DYNAMIC  EFFECTIVE  CONNECTIVITY"

by Wei Zhang, Ivor Cribben, Sonia Petrone and Michele Guindani

## First Simulation

SIMULATION1_DATA_GENERATION.R and SIMULATION1.R replicate the first simulation in the manuscript. They demonstrate an example of using the BTVT-VAR package.


## Metropolis coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm

MC3.R contains an example of applying BTVT-VAR model with Metropolis coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo (MC^3) algorithm.
